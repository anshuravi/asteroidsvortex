# asteroidsvortex
Asteroids of the Vortex is based on my love for science fiction and history. The purpose of this game is to remind us that history repeats itself. As the player goes through time, asteroids from the time vortex try and infiltrate Earth. The point of the game is to overcome all the asteroids before time runs out. The catch of the game is that the more asteroids that hit you, the more you will be thrown from the center of the frame making it harder to aim. The asteroids symbolize the different hardships that hit humanity through time. Designed as a single player game, it takes one person to overcome the asteroids symbolizing how a single act can help humanity in ways unimaginable. 

The game is coded in JavaScript with p5.js, and the p5.play library. It is placed on the web with Github. HTML and CSS are used to enhance the overall design. The user experience and controls use mainly keyboard interactions with “s” to start, arrow keys to move the ship, “x” to shoot, and“r” to travel through time. There is a timer that once runs out directly takes the player to the game over screen. There is also the ability to restart the time vortex at any point of the game with a button input.
